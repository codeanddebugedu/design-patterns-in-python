## Low-Level Design in Python

This repository is a **practical course on Low-Level Design (LLD) in Python**, focused on applying object-oriented principles and design patterns through small, hands-on examples.

### What you’ll learn
- **OOP recap**: Classes, objects, inheritance, composition, interfaces (via abstract base classes), and more.
- **UML basics**: Association, aggregation, composition, inheritance, and dependency.
- **Clean low-level design**: How to translate requirements into classes, methods, and interactions.
- **Pythonic implementation**: How common design ideas are expressed idiomatically in Python.

Additional modules, examples, and patterns will be added over time as the course evolves.

### Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of:
  - Python syntax (functions, modules, imports)
  - Classes, objects, and methods

### Goals of the course
- **Build intuition** for designing classes and interactions before coding.
- **Develop a design vocabulary** (OOP, UML, patterns) you can use in interviews and real projects.
- **Bridge the gap** between high-level requirements and concrete Python code.

As the course grows, this README will be updated with new sections, patterns, and exercises.
